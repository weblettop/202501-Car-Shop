                  around 1993, and I think it was called "Ford Triton" - a
                  cargo-passenger car with a carbon fiber body, I fell in love
                  with this car. And at the end of 2003 I bought a used "Ford
                  Explorer" in the "Eddie Bauer" configuration, to put it simply
                  - it has everything.
